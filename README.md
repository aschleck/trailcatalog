# Trailcatalog

Trailcatalog organizes OpenStreetMaps trail relations into a searchable catalog. It syncs to OSM
every Monday and Thursday at 2am PST. https://trailcatalog.org

## Corgi

This uses my JS framework [Corgi](https://github.com/aschleck/corgi/tree/main/js/corgi). I think
it's cool and I hope you do too.

## S2

This project depends on Google's
[S2 Geometry Library](https://github.com/google/s2-geometry-library-java) and we host an S2 cell
viewer at https://s2.trailcatalog.org. Left-click to toggle cells, right-click to see cell
information.
